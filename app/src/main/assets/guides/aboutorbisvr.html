<p>Orbis VR is brought to you by a team of motivated students at the European School of Ixelles. As a group of millennials, we find the concept of Virtual Reality fascinating, and so we wanted to offer an affordable alternative to expensive Virtual Reality headsets. Our talented programmers, Jakob and Jan, designed this app to add a personal twist to our project. Orbis enhances the capabilities of your smartphone camera, giving your photographs an element of depth and dimension.</p>
