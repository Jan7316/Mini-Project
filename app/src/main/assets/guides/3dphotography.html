<p> 3D images are generated when each eye sees a slightly different image, resulting in the illusion
    of depth. With the Orbis camera, you will be able to create your own 3D photographs.<br>
    <ol type="1">
    <li>First, press the + at the top right of the gallery page. Select ‘Take’. Take a photo of your
    object.</li>
    <li>Then, holding the camera as steady as possible, move your phone approximately 7
    centimetres to the right, and take another photo. It is important that your subject does not
    move between the two pictures. Orbis will stitch the photos together and distort them
    accordingly.</li>
    <li>Finally, insert your phone into the Orbis headset to view your image.</li> </ol></p>

<p> Mastering this process may take some practice, but there are a few more things you can do to tap
    the full potential of our app as soon as you are familiar with the basics:<br>
    Experiment with the distance between shots for increased depth. Wider range will enhance the
    effect of landscape pictures, while a distance roughly equal to the distance between your eyes
    is suitable for close-up photos.<br>
    The ‘Stitch Together’ option in the + menu allows you to import images taken on other devices
    than your phone. You can carry out the above process with a digital DSLR and import the images
    for enhanced image quality. <br>
    Furthermore, you can overcome the limitation of still photography (as your subject can not move
    between the two photos) by holding two phones next to each other and taking the pictures
    simultaneously. This allows you to freeze motion in a stunning 3D picture. However, you have to
    make sure that the settings (including focal length, white balance and focus) are as similar as
    possible on both devices.<br>
    <br>
    In addition to your own images, there are thousands of Virtual Reality photos and videos available on the Internet.</p>
