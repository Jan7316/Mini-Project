<p>3D images are generated when each eye sees a slightly different image, resulting in the illusion
    of depth. With the Orbis camera, you will be able to create your own 3D photographs.<br>
    <ol type="1">
    <li>First, press the + at the top right of the gallery page. Select ‘Take’. Take a photo of your
        object.</li>
    <li>Then, holding the camera as steady as possible, move your phone approximately 7
    centimetres to the right, and take another photo. Orbis will stitch the photos together and
    distort them accordingly.</li>
    <li>Finally, insert your phone into the Orbis headset to view your image.</li> </ol>
    Experiment with the distance between shots for increased depth. Wider range will enhance the
    effect of landscape pictures, while a distance roughly equal to the distance between your eyes
    is suitable for close-up photos.<br>
    <br>
    In addition to your own images, there are thousands of Virtual Reality photos and videos available on the Internet.</p>
